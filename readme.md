# Stereoscope

Stereoscope is a web-based prototype for visualizing two core processes of literary studies - hermeneutic exploration of textual meaning and construction of arguments about texts. In Stereoscope scholars can represent their manually created digital annotations with multiple visualizations to record and convey qualitative statements. Different visual representations of annotation data allow multiple perspectives which, in combination with comments and tags, provide the means to craft scholarly arguments about literary works and make them transparent to readers.
